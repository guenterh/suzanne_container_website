RELEASE NOTES FOR TYPO3 4.0
****************************

This page contains all important 4.0 specific information.

Symlink Change
===============

* Starting with TYPO3 4.0beta3, internal symlinks are not used
  anymore. This means, that there will be no symlinks inside the
  typo3_src/ folder. However, some extensions are not correctly
  adopted to the new scheme, therefore you may want to add the
  symlinks again to prevent any problems.

* If you are upgrading from an older version, you will need to change
  the symlink index.php (pointing to tslib/index_ts.php in TYPO3_3.8.1
  and before) to point to typo3_src/index.php in TYPO3 4.0:

  $ rm index.php
  $ ln -s typo3_src/index.php index.php

  (provided you have linked the "typo3_src" folder to your TYPO3 source
  folder, e.g. "typo3_src-4.0/")

* Please keep in mind that there will be no symlinks anymore from the
  provided fonts nimbus.ttf and vera.ttf to arial.ttf and verdana.ttf. If
  you depend on these fonts, you need to upload the original fonts
  manually or create symlinks to these look-alike-fonts in t3lib/fonts/.


local/global/system extensions
===============================

* Again, some extensions have been changed to system extensions. This
  means, they are now located in typo3/sysext/. However, since
  typo3conf/ext/ and typo3/ext/ will take precedence, make sure that the
  extensions are not kept in these directories anymore.

* If you want to remove extensions from typo3conf/ext/ or typo3/ext/
  because they are now a system extension (rtehtmlarea for example) then
  don't forget to remove the temp_CACHED_* files in typo3conf/ manually.


Localization/Language packs
============================

* The old csh_[lang-key] extensions are not used anymore.

* Please go to the EM and use the new function "Translation
  handling". There you just select all languages you want to to carry
  within your installation.

* For one-time initial update or later synchronisation you need to use
  the button "Update from repository".

* On installing additional extensions later on the EM automatically
  takes care to import the appropriate language-packs as selected (only
  if available of course)! You only need to use the "Translation handling"
  if you want to update/check lables with the translation-server


Important UTF-8 database settings change
=========================================

* For using TYPO3 version 4.0, on a MySQL-4.1 (maybe other versions)
  with a UTF-8 based database, please refer to the details of
  http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=1262.


New Skin
=========

* TYPO3 Version 4.0 is shipped with a new default skin developed by Thomas
  Murphy and the design team. It is enabled by default. If you would like
  to switch back to the original skin you can just do so by uninstalling
  the extension "t3skin" in the Extension Manager.


Quickstart and Testsite packages
=================================

* Notice that the "Quickstart" and the "Testsite" packages are no longer
  provided. Instead, you can get them as a T3D file which can be imported
  using the Import/Export extension.
  See http://typo3.org/download/packages/ for details.
